This gem handle whether user can access the resources. Resource cab be project, document, etc.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'acts_as_resource'
```

    $ bundle

Generate migration and run it

```shell
rails g acts_as_resource:migration
rake db:migrate
```

## Usage

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_accessable resources: [ :projects ]
  # resources option help to define has_many :projects
  # resources option is optional
end

class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_resource accessors: [ :users ]
  # accessors option help to define has_many :users association
  # accessors option is optional
end

user = User.create!
project = Project.create!

user.projects
# => [ ]
project.users
# => [ ]
user.can_access?(project)
# => false
project.accessible_by?(user)
# => false

user.projects << project # or project.users << user
user.projects
# => [ project ]
project.users
# => [ user ]
user.can_access?(project)
# => true
project.accessible_by?(user)
# => true

another_user = User.create!
another_user.can_access?(project)
# => false
```

## How it works?
In install step, migration will create [`resourceships`](https://github.com/darren987469/acts_as_resource/blob/master/lib/acts_as_resource/resourceship.rb) table. This table help to store accessors and resources' relation.
